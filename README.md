### CRISPR Screening Bioinformatics Analysis
We will review the process of analyzing CRISPR screening libraries using Mageck as a command-line tool and MageckFlute in RStudio. This will include the following steps:
	- Quality Control Checks
	- UMI Deduplication
	- Mageck count
	- MaGeCKFlute statistical analysis in R
